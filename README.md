A passion side project of mine.  An interest in college was Anthropology and one of the main reasons I began my coding adventure.  This site allows those who are learning to see, at a very broad example, of how diet effects the skeletal structure of the human cranium.  A brief introduction to the way this works.

In the simplest terms, what you eat will indicate the structure of your skull.  Eating food that is harder to chew, takes more energy, or even foods like nuts, these have the effect of having your zygomatic structure become a bit more robust than those who would eat fruits as their main diet.  This project came about to explore the evolutionary changes the modern human would face in a few thousand years with a primary planet-based diet.  As well as to see the effects from the dairy infused diet introduced in Europe roughly 4000 years ago.

*The math in this project is still being adjusted and explored. As such what you see here is a model only to simulate an extreme change that is in no way realistic. *

**For a proper report, please look at the document attached on the bottom.**


The Home screen gives a description of what the "young archeologist" will be engaging.  A simple design, though the changes made to stay clear of the basic black and white or even the neutral tones most researchers deal with on the majority of their projects, the color scheme was chosen at random.  (From throwing a dart on a color rainbow wheel.  This was the first color chosen and then the remainder was to match.)

Here we can see a login as well as a registration prompt.  The user is encouraged to make a account to help save their information for future projects as well as a way to return and explore any scenarios that were created.

Since the majority of us don’t enjoy popups while exploring pages, this was made to allow us to dismiss the description before we register the account.  The new user must put in function information otherwise a popup alert will advise them on how to proceed.  Such as a password that did not match, an email that does not exist or a name that is too short.  (This is so no one places an initial, though it is not discouraged to do so, it is hard to recall if you placed your name or a fake name, these alerts help to keep user information easier to remember for said user.)

Our Home Screen has yet another pop up on the bottom of the screen to help guide the new user.  The users name is displayed on top of the screen to welcome them.  There we may see the logout button as well as an Add Model button for when the user is ready to explore some dietary changes.

Further, the models’ other users have created are present for viewing.  This will show the new user who created the model and the title of the model itself.  Once we move to select the chosen model the new user wishes to explore, it will bring them to a new page where they are able to see the model and the changes made to said model.  The notes the "young archeologist" had made during their research on these diets as well as why they wanted to create this diet for this model.

There is an edit and a delete function that is available to THE ONE WHO CREATED THE MODEL only.  Other users as well as administrators are not permitted to edit and or delete any other users work.

WWhen the new user wishes to add a model of their own, they choose the "Add Model" button link on the top of the page.  This will lead them to the model and the diets they may choose from to explore.  The model is based on a modern human cranium and is subjected to alterations as this site is continued to be modified with new researching material surfacing.

Each diet choice allows for a different change.  This is based on research indicated in the pdf paper attached on the bottom.

This is purely to show the button hover effect.

Finally, we see the Sequel Ace tables and how they play about in this site.

*Updated papers will be added as the research continues*
